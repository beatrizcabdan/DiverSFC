# DiverSFC ðŸŒ€  
**Measuring Data Diversity After Dimensionality Reduction Using Space-Filling Curves**

**DiverSFC** is a research and analysis toolkit designed to measure **data diversity** in lower-dimensional embeddings.  
It leverages **space-filling curves (SFCs)** to map multi-dimensional data (mostly from the automotive domain) into a one-dimensional representation, enabling efficient diversity quantification and comparison between datasets or models.

This repository provides tools to:
- Apply **space-filling curve mappings** to embedded data.
  - **Hilbert Curve:** Strong locality preservation, ideal for structured embeddings.  
  - **Morton (Z-order):** Fast to compute, used in indexing and spatial databases.  
- Compute **diversity metrics** (e.g., entropy, coverage, dispersion) on the 1D SFC domain.

## CSP ranges 

CSP range for valid speeds and steering wheel angles (based on properties of real trajectory data):

First, samples with different speeds appear, then, different maximum steering wheel angles appear. This example illustrates the bit-shifting issue when measuring the distance between CSPs.
